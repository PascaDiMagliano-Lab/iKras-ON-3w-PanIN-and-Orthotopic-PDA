Processed data and downstream analysis of scRNA Seq experiments for the paper Regulatory T cell depletion causes compensatory immune suppression and accelerated pancreatic carcinogenesis. 

This repository includes the normalized, scaled, batch corrected, filtered data and R script that will replicate Figures and Supplementary Figures . 

To replicate the analysis, load the R script into R Studio and load the data into the Global Environment. Running the R script as described will generate the figures found in the manuscript.
